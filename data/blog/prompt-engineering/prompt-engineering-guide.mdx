# Introduction

During my work on crafting prompts for the Earthmera eco-action detection LLM model, I discovered that
even small changes in the prompt could significantly impact the model's performance. Initially, I wrote
the prompts without any specific guidelines or structure, relying solely on plain English sentences.
However, the results were disappointing and fell short of my expectations. This led me to delve deeper
into the field of prompt engineering, where I learned various techniques to enhance the model's performance.
In this blog post, I'll share some of the key strategies I discovered and applied to optimize prompts
effectively.
